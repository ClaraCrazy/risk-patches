# Risk (Discord Bot Cog)

This is a custom Discord bot cog for playing **Risk**, a strategy game of world domination. This cog was developed by **ZaidAli** as a **paid bounty** from **ClaraCrazy** and is part of the **bounty-cogs** repository.

## About the Game

Risk is a turn-based strategy board game where players deploy armies, conquer territories, and strategize to control the entire map. Players take turns attacking, defending, and fortifying their positions to eliminate opponents and achieve world domination. This Discord implementation automates the game mechanics, allowing users to play within a Discord server.

## Features

- Turn-based gameplay with attack and defense mechanics.
- Reinforcement and fortification phases.
